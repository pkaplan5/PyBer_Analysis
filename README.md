## PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Performed

To create the analysis provided, data was collected from ride sharing actitivity. The emphasis was placed on data grouped by location type, divided into Suburban, Rural, and Urban locations. Summary descriptive statistics were provided such as the mean of data for fares collected.


## Overview of the analysis

The final analysis provided looked at total fares collected from the three location types, urban, rural, and suburban. 

## Results

One observation made was that Urban locations collected much more fare per week compared to suburban and rural destinations with peaks in the warmer months. All destinations had lower fare based on the seasonality of the data. Another observation made was that urban locations had more drivers and were able to collect more fares based on the availability of drivers.

## Recommendations

Based on the results a few things can be done to improve the quality of the ride sharing program.

* The number of drivers can be increased during peak times to allow more riders to join the program.
* Urban and surburban locales coould have more drivers available to allow more riders to use the program.
* Cities that have higher usage could offer incentives to drivers to increased the number of drivers in these locations.
